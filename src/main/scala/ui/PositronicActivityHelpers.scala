/** Trait to help an activity manage requests on other activities.

  * This trait provides utility wrappers around the standard
  * `startActivityForResult` and `onActivityResult` functions which
  * automate some of the necessary bookkeeping.  The general outline
  * is that at Activity `onCreate` time, or when creating or recreating
  * instance state, some associated object with the
  * [[org.positronicnet.ui.ActivityResultDispatchClient]] trait
  * can register for activity result dispatch.  Having done so, it
  * can then later call:
  * {{{
  *    awaitActivityResult( intent, "methodName", arg1, arg2, ... )
  * }}}
  * The named method must be declared roughly like so:
  * {{{
  *    def methodName( resultCode: Int, resultIntent: Intent,
  *                    arg1: Arg1Type, arg2: Arg2Type, ... ): Unit = ...
  * }}}
  * Also, the argN items, if any, must be serializable.  This call
  * delegates to the running activity, which then
  * then allocates a "request code", associates the method name and
  * arguments with that request code, and calls `startActivityForResult`
  * as normal.
  *
  * The upshot is that the code that makes the request and the code
  * that handles the result can be in the same place, making the whole
  * flow of control easier to read.
  *
  * However, to make this work, the trait needs to allocate "request
  * codes" on its own --- meaning that it's a rather bad idea to use
  * these routines, and *also* to use `startActivityForResult` directly.
  * (If you must, overriding `minAutomaticActivityRequestCode`
  * to exceed the largest you're using on your own at least makes
  * it possible to avoid collisions; you should also make sure your
  * `onActivityResult` calls `super` to handle the automatically
  * assigned ones.)
  *
  * The possibility of this sort of conflict, and the need to manage
  * it, are the main reason that you have to mix these routines in
  * explicitly, as opposed to getting them for free with the rest of
  * [[org.positronicnet.ui.PositronicActivityHelpers]].
  *
  * (It would be more convenient to define the callbacks as lambdas,
  * and that actually works... so long as the process that registers
  * the lambda is the one that receives the result.  If that process
  * dies though --- and the system has license to kill it at any time
  * while the other activity is running --- the lambda dies with it.)
